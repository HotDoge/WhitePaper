# HotDoge (HDOG) Whitepaper  

## Introduction  
HotDoge (HDOG) is a community-driven meme coin that combines humor, blockchain technology, and viral culture.  
Our mascot — a dachshund inside a hot dog bun — represents friendliness, creativity, and the playful spirit of crypto.  

HotDoge was designed to be:  
- **No Premine** — Everyone starts equally  
- **No Dev Tax** — 100% belongs to the community  
- **Proof-of-Work Fair Launch** — Only hashing power matters  

Our philosophy: **fun meets transparency**.
